# Ising_model
A simple implementation (no classes) in c++ of the Ising model with no external field. The Single-Flip and Wolff algorithms are available. For simplicity, all parameters are defined in parameters.h. But is perfectly possible reading the constants from an external file. Any suggestions on how to improve the code or fix bugs are very welcome.
